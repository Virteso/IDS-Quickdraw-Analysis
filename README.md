# IDS-Quickdraw-Analysis

Authors: Rasmus Lille, Aksel Martin Muru

## Goals
With this project we wanted to
train a model that could name
objects from input doodles. This was made possible by the public
Google Quick! Draw dataset that is publicly available at
https://github.com/googlecreativelab/quickdraw-dataset/.
We set a goal of 75% accuracy with
the predicted object types.
